//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friendsNames = ["Ayesha" , "Aimal" , "Sadia" , "Fatima" , "Manahil"]
friendsNames.forEach(y => console.log(`Assalam-o-Alaikum ${y} , How are you ?`))
