// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly

//define a function to create a car object with optional options

function create_car(manufacturer , model, ...options){
    //initialize a car object with manufacturer and model

    let car={
        manufacturer : manufacturer,
        model : model
    };

    //add additional options to the car opjects

    options.forEach(option => {
        let [key , value] = option.split(":");
        car[key.trim()] = value.trim()
    });
    return car;
}

//call a function to return a car object
let my_car = create_car("Toyota" , "corolla" , "color : Red" , "sunRoof : true");
console.log(my_car);
