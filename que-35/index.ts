// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!



// // MAKING AN ARRAY
 let pets_animals = ["Cat" , "Dog" , "Cow"]

// //USING FOR LOOP
 for(let one_animal of pets_animals){
     console.log(`A ${one_animal} , would make a great pet`)
 }

// //PRINT A MESSAGE OUTSIDE OF FOR LOOP
 console.log("Any of these animals would make a great pet")
