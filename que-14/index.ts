//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guests = ["Hadia" , "Sawera" , "Jaweria" , "Muntaha"]
guests.forEach(guest => console.log(`I have arranged a dinner ${guest},  and i will be very happy if you will join us`))
