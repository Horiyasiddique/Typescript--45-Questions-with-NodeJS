//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items

let languages : string[] = ["Urdu" , "Arabic" , "English" , "Spanish" , "Turkish"]
console.log("list of my favourite languages");

languages.forEach(lang => console.log(lang))
